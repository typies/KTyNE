KTyNE is a website designed to aid in playing as the "Expert" in the video game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" (https://keeptalkinggame.com/). It is meant to combine helpful resources that I found myself needed often when playing in 1 page and bundle it up in a nice UI.

This project also served as a good excuse to practice some rusty HTML/CSS/JS skills.
